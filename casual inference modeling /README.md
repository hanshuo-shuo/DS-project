# Intro

The problem that we want to study is the effects of lunch types (free/reduced and standard) on
how the students perform the exam. Our rationale behind this question is as follows: This variable
is a direct correlation to the income of parents and whether the students take enough food after
class in the US. First ,the requirement for applying is that your parents income is below a certain
level. The income of the parents also affects the development of the students. Also, the free or
reduced lunch might not be as good as the standard one, and this variable also shows the students’
eating style outside of campus (Since students who can afford lunch are more likely to eat better
at home dinner and during weekends while the students who have free lunch might not eat enough
after school), which may affect the physical conditions of the students, like brain development. If
we can find out the effect does exist, we can give some concrete evidence to relevant policy makers
to make some changes like give such group of students more benefice such as free dinner when
there is enough funding. Then we might encourage more students who suffer from poverty to have
better performance at school.
