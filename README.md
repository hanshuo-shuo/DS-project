- Multilevel Modeling (MLM) and Longitudinal Data Modeling are statistical techniques for analyzing complex data structures. MLM, also known as hierarchical linear modeling, is used for data that has a hierarchical or nested structure, considering the inherent variability at each level.
-  Longitudinal data modeling, which includes mixed-effects models, generalized estimating equations, growth curve models, and survival analysis, is utilized for analyzing data collected over multiple time points. 
-  Generalized Linear Models (GLM) provide flexibility for analyzing data with different types of distributions. 
-  These techniques have a wide application in dealing with practical data scenarios, including missing values and non-linear relationships. 
-  Model selection methods such as AIC, BIC, stepwise regression, and cross-validation aid in determining the most suitable model for a given dataset.
